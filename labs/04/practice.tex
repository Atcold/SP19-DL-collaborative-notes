Select natural signal: \begin{verbatim}audio.wav\end{verbatim}

%% Insert wave form here

The wave form constitutes of the magnitudes aka. volume in the time domain. To analyze it in the frequency domain where pitch can be seen and potentially separated, we use discrete Fourier Transform to obtain the Fourier Transform over every windowed signal. The resulting graph is called a spectrogram, which represents the signal in the frequency domain.

%% Insert two spectrograms here

The challenge is to figure out which corresponding piano keys we should play to reproduce the audio.
